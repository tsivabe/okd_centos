**Note:** Update: November 2019 - I no longer work at Red Hat on the OpenShift team.  Given that, I will not be updating this repo to work with OpenShift 4.x on baremetal.  My future work will be centered on a more pure upstream kubernetes experience.  If a community member wants to add support for 4.x, I will gladly accept a PR.

Install RedHat OKD 3.11 on your own server.  For a local only install, it is suggested that you use CDK or MiniShift instead of this repo.  This install method is targeted for a single node cluster that has a long life.

This repository is a set of scripts that will allow you easily install the latest version (3.11) of OKD in a single node fashion.  What that means is that all of the services required for OKD to function (master, node, etcd, etc.) will all be installed on a single host.  The script supports a custom hostname which you can provide using the interactive mode.

**If you are wanting to install OCP on RDO (OpenStack)**

Michel Peterson has created a wrapper script in his repo that will do all the heavy lifting for you. Check it out!

**Please do use a clean CentOS system, the script installs all necesary tools and packages including Ansible, container runtime, etc.**

> **Warning about Let's Encrypt setup available on this project:**
> Let's Encrypt only works if the IP is using publicly accessible IP and custom certificates."
> This feature doesn't work with OpenShift CLI for now.

## Installation

1. Create a VM as explained in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkFIozGY0IA (this video) by Grant Shipley

2. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/okd-community-install/installcentos.git
```

3. Execute the installation script

```
cd installcentos
./install-openshift.sh
```

## Automation
1. Define mandatory variables for the installation process

```
# Domain name to access the cluster
$ export DOMAIN=<public ip address>.nip.io

# User created after installation
$ export USERNAME=<current user name>

# Password for the user
$ export PASSWORD=password
```

2. Define optional variables for the installation process

```
# Instead of using loopback, setup DeviceMapper on this disk.
# !! All data on the disk will be wiped out !!
$ export DISK="/dev/sda"
```

3. Run the automagic installation script as root with the environment variable in place:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okd-community-install/installcentos/master/install-openshift.sh | INTERACTIVE=false /bin/bash
```

## Development

For development it's possible to switch the script repo

```
# Change location of source repository
$ export SCRIPT_REPO="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okd-community-install/installcentos/master"
$ curl $SCRIPT_REPO/install-openshift.sh | /bin/bash
```

## Testing

The script is tested using the tooling in the `validate` directory.

To use the tooling, it's required to create file `validate/env.sh` with the DigitalOcean API key

```
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=""
```

and then run `start.sh` to start the provisioning. Once the ssh is connected to the server, the
script will atatch to the `tmux` session running Ansible installer.

To destroy the infrastructure, run the `stop.sh` script.
